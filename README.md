# BroCOLI : Bron-Kerbosch calibrator of Long-read Isoform
## About
BroCOLI (Bron-Kerbosch calibrator of Long-read Isoform) leverages efficient algorithms for transcript identification and quantification from long-read RNA-Seq data, supporting both bulk and single-cell applications, while maintaining low memory usage and fast performance for large-scale datasets.

## Requirements
**C++11** compatible compiler (e.g. **g++ 4.8** or later).

If you are a Linux user, you can check your g++ version with the following code.
```shell
g++ --version
```

## Installation
In order to compile the BroCOLI source in this GitHub repository the following steps can be taken:
```
git clone https://github.com/weiwei4396/BroCOLI.git
```
```
cd BroCOLI
sh build.sh
```
Once compiled, two executables ( **BroCOLI_bulk** and **BroCOLI_sc** ) will appear in the **BroCOLI folder**. You can use either the -h (--help) argument or the demo data to verify if the program runs successfully.
```
./BroCOLI_bulk -h
./BroCOLI_sc -h
```

## Supported sequencing data
BroCOLI support all kinds of long RNA data:
- ONT cDNA/ONT dRNA
- PacBio

**Please align your reads to the reference genome and provide the resulting sorted SAM file to BroCOLI.**

## Supported reference data
- Reference genome should be provided in **FASTA** format.
- Reference annotation is not required, but providing it will yield better results. If a reference gene annotation is available, please provide it in **GTF** format.

## General usage
### Bulk data
#### Step1 Mapping of the fastq files with minimap2
One alignment tool that could be considered is [Minimap2](https://github.com/lh3/minimap2).

The input **SAM files** need to be **sorted** by samtools before running BroCOLI.
```shell
samtools sort -o sorted.sam unsorted.sam
```
#### Step2 Transcript identification and quantification
```shell
./BroCOLI_bulk -s sam_files_path -a fasta.fa -g GTF.gtf -o output_path
```
### Single cell data
#### Step1 Processing fastq files with Sicelore and wf-single-cell
[Sicelore](https://github.com/ucagenomix/sicelore-2.1) and [wf-single-cell](https://github.com/epi2me-labs/wf-single-cell) can be used to process FASTQ files into SAM files.

#### Step2 Transcript identification and quantification
```shell
./BroCOLI_sc -s sam_files_path -a fasta.fa -g GTF.gtf -o output_path
```
## Output files
1. After BroCOLI finishes processing the **bulk data**, a total of five files will be generated.
- `counts_transcript.txt`: Quantitative results of all transcripts contained in all samples.
    + Column 1 indicates Ensembl ID of each transcript.
    + Column 2 indicates Ensembl ID of each gene. Note that some novel transcripts are located in genes that are unclear, so BroCOLI represents its gene id as NA when output.
    + Column 3 to the end indicates the read count of transcript in each sample. The number of columns is equal to the number of samples.
- `counts_gene.txt`: Quantitative results of all genes contained in all samples. The result does not contain rows whose gene_id is NA.
    + Column 1 indicates Ensembl ID of each gene.
    + Column 2 to the end indicates the read count of gene in each sample. The number of columns is equal to the number of samples.
- `updated_annotitions.gtf`: An updated GTF annotation that includes both annotated and novel isoforms for the detected transcripts. 
    + The source column indicates for each isoform whether it is a `novel isoform` and `annotated isoform`.
    + The information for each isoform is recorded as one line, and the exon information as the next few lines.
- `compatible_isoform.tsv`: The result of each read assigned to the transcript in each sample file.
    + Column 1 (read_id) represents the read id presented in sam file. In the case of multiple sample files, column 5 specifies the file associated with each read.
    + Column 2 (category) specifies the classification of the isoform to which each read is associated. BroCOLI divided read into four categories: FSM, ISM, single_exon, and approximate. FSM is full splice match. ISM is incomplete splice match. Single_exon indicates that the isoform has only one exon. Approximate means that reads are approximately grouped into this isoform by Bron-Kerbosch algorithm.
    + Column 3 (isoform_id) provides the Ensembl ID of the isoform associated with each read.
    + Column 4 (gene_id) provides the Ensembl ID of the gene associated with each read.
    + Column 5 (file) contains a numerical index for each sample, and the corresponding representative files can be found in `file_explain.txt`.
- `file_explain.txt`: It contains a mapping between samples and a numerical index, which starts at 0 and ends at the number of samples minus one.
    + Column 1 provides an index of BroCOLI's given sample
    + Column 2 corresponds to the absolute path of the SAM file for each sample.

2. After BroCOLI finishes processing the **single cell data**, a total of four files will be generated.
- `counts_transcript_index.txt`: A matrix of **transcripts Ã— cells**, with quantitative data obtained from each sample. The index denotes the serial number of the sample. The mapping between the sample and its number is provided in the `file_explain.txt` file or in BroCOLI's output history.
    + Column 1 indicates Ensembl ID of each transcript.
    + Column 2 indicates Ensembl ID of each gene. Note that some novel transcripts are located in genes that are unclear, so BroCOLI represents its gene id as NA when output.
    + Columns 3 and onwards represent the read count of transcripts for each cell, with each column corresponding to a specific cell. The column headers are the barcode IDs of the cells.
- `updated_annotitions.gtf`: An updated GTF annotation that includes both annotated and novel isoforms for the detected transcripts.
    + The source column indicates for each isoform whether it is a `novel isoform` and `annotated isoform`.
    + The information for each isoform is recorded as one line, and the exon information as the next few lines.
- `compatible_isoform.tsv`: The result of each read assigned to the transcript in each sample file. In contrast to the bulk results, an additional column for the barcode ID is included to specify the cell from which each read originates.
    + Column 1 (read_id) represents the read id presented in sam file. In the case of multiple sample files, column 5 specifies the file associated with each read.
    + Column 2 (category) specifies the classification of the isoform to which each read is associated. BroCOLI divided read into four categories: FSM, ISM, single_exon, and approximate. FSM is full splice match. ISM is incomplete splice match. Single_exon indicates that the isoform has only one exon. Approximate means that reads are approximately grouped into this isoform by Bron-Kerbosch algorithm.
    + Column 3 (isoform_id) provides the Ensembl ID of the isoform associated with each read.
    + Column 4 (gene_id) provides the Ensembl ID of the gene associated with each read.
    + Column 5 (barcode_id) The barcode_id represents the unique identifier of the cell to which the corresponding read is assigned.
    + Column 6 (file) contains a numerical index for each sample, and the corresponding representative files can be found in `file_explain.txt`.
- `file_explain.txt`: It contains a mapping between samples and a numerical index, which starts at 0 and ends at the number of samples minus one.
    + Column 1 provides an index of BroCOLI's given sample
    + Column 2 corresponds to the absolute path of the SAM file for each sample.
