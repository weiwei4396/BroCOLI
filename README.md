## About
BroCOLI (Bron-Kerbosch calibrator of Long-read Isoform) leverages efficient algorithms for transcript identification and quantification from long-read RNA-Seq data, supporting both bulk and single-cell applications, while maintaining low memory usage and fast performance for large-scale datasets. 

## Requirements
BroCOLI requires a C++11 compatible compiler (e.g., g++ 4.8 or later).

## 🛠️ Installation
In order to compile the BroCOLI source in this GitHub repository the following steps can be taken:
```console
git clone https://github.com/weiwei4396/BroCOLI.git
```
```console
cd BroCOLI
sh build.sh
```
Once compiled, two executables ( **BroCOLI_bulk** and **BroCOLI_sc** ) will appear in the **BroCOLI folder**. You can use either the -h (--help) argument or the demo data to verify if the program runs successfully.
```console
./BroCOLI_bulk -h
./BroCOLI_sc -h
```
